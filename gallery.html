            <br /><br />
            Hey! My name is Maxime Perreault, but you can call me Maxi. I’m a
            queer québécois artist working with mixed-digital medias and I
            create using a few different tools, software, methods, and
            programming languages. I am also a tattoo artist working in
            Tiohtià:ke (Montreal).
            <br /><br />
            Digital medias excite me. I get inspired a lot by new software
            functionalities, new algorithms, new methods, I guess you could say
            by novelty in general. Another thing would be the human body, or the
            deformation of it. It took me a while to understand why I loved body
            modifications so much, but I think the main reason is that I can
            have authority over my own physical form through them. As a tattoo
            artist, it brings me a lot of joy to know I can help others with
            negative ideas of their own bodies, sometimes taking shape as body
            dysmorphia, fat-shame, and internalized self-hate. As a digital
            artist, it makes me want to explore different ways to represent
            bodies and physical health, whether it's through deformed humanoid
            3d models, data visualization of illnesses and addictions, or
            organic generative art.
