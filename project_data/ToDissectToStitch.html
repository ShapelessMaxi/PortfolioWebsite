<!-- description -->
<p>This interactive installation is a kind of puzzle made of my own 3D scanned body, inspired by academic literature in queer theory. The final piece acts as a manifesto regarding body-related and perception-based societal norms. In the end, I see it as a kind of auto-ethnographic process where I was able to analyze the external perception, as well as my own, of my body, both in a deconstructed and reconstructed state. With MediaPipe, a machine learning tool, the viewer in front of a visual composition of myself with heavy medical and 'objective' undertones can replace the pieces back in place using hand gestures. The experience is complete when the viewer sees the whole manifesto written in the place of a previously dry descriptions of each body parts.
